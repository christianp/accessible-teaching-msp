# Things you can do

This section breaks down practical steps that you can take to integrate
accessibility into your module design and teaching. We explain why and
how to provide some common adjustments, which disabilities may
neccessitate such an adjustment and advice for when it may be difficult
to do this in practice.

## Providing all course materials in acccessible formats

### Why should I do this?

Anybody can benefit from using assistive technology to aide their
studies. Assistive technology spans a broad range of tools which can be
anything from a screen reader to braille displays and screen magnifiers.
For a document to be accessible it must allow use of these assistive
technologies and be able to be adapted for specific needs.

### How should I do this?

Creating accessible course materials involves following best practices
and using appropriate tools to ensure compatibility with assistive
technologies. Here are some detailed steps and recommendations:

#### Provide documents in accessible formats

- **HTML:** What is considered an accessible document varies depending on the use,
but the "gold standard" for accessible documents is HTML. PDFs can be
considered accessible in some ways, if they are created correctly, but
this is uncommon and time consuming. [Chirun is a tool which converts
LaTeX to an accessible HTML format.](https://chirun.org.uk/)

- **Everything, everywhere:** It's not just lecture notes that need to be accessible. Problem sheets,
solutions, statistical tables, slides, assignments, communications, etc.
all need to be available in an accessible format. There should not be
any course material without an accessible equivalent.

- **Canvas:** Canvas is an accessible platform. Anything posted on the Canvas course
(i.e., announcements, pages etc) is accessible for users of assistive
technology.

#### Design for Accessibility

- **Headings and structure:** Use proper headings and a logical document structure. This helps screen
reader users navigate the document more easily.

- **Cognitive load:** Consider how easy it is to find a specific resource and how easy they
are to use (i.e., if a problem sheet requires the use of a statistical
table include it on the problem sheet so students don't have to switch
between tabs/windows constantly).

- **Alt text:** Provide descriptive alt text for all images, charts, and graphs to
convey the content to visually impaired users.

- **Tables:** Ensure tables are used for data, not layout, and include proper headers
to make them accessible to screen readers.

- **Links:** Use descriptive link text that makes sense out of context (e.g., "View
the syllabus" instead of "Click here").

- **Colours:** Ensure sufficient color contrast between text and background to aid
readability for visually impaired users.

### Who does it benefit?

Every student!

But in particular, the [Supportive Practice Tool](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/learning-and-teaching/effective-practice/universal-design/supportive-practice-tool/) 
and the list of disability specific [reasonable adjustments](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/learning-and-teaching/support-and-student-skills/personal-tutoring/resources-and-training/reasonable-adjustments/)
provided by Student Health and Wellbeing Service (SHWS) suggest that the following disabilities/conditions may necessitate this adjustment:

-   ADHD
-   Anxiety
-   Autism
-   Cancer
-   Chronic Fatigue Syndrome
-   D/deaf
-   Depression
-   Diabetes
-   Dyspraxia
-   Epilepsy
-   IBD and IBS
-   Migraine
-   Mobility difficulties
-   Specific Learning Difficulty (SpLD)
-   Visual Impairment

Note: this is not an all-encompassing nor exhaustive list. Some students
with the above disabilities/conditions may not require this adjustment
and many other disabilities/conditions not listed may necessitate this
adjustment

### This might be difficult if

- **Your material is all handwritten.** You'll have to produce a typeset version of your material for any students who can't access the handwritten notes. In the past, we have paid student interns to transcribe handwritten notes.
- **You don't have the source code for some material.** First of all, check that you're complying with any licensing requirements for material you didn't make yourself. If you can ask the original creator for an accessible version, do so.
- **It's all in slides.** Chirun can convert Beamer slides to HTML. If your slides are made with PowerPoint, upload the .pptx file as well as a PDF version to Canvas.


## Consistently uploading materials in advance

### Why should I do this?

Uploading course materials in advance provides substantial benefits for
students with disabilities, as well as the broader student population.
Neurodivergent students often experience difficulties with executive
functioning and working memory, which effects planning, organization,
and time management ([Christopher & Macdonald, 2005; Lukasik et al.,
2019; Habib et al., 2019; Barkley & Poillion, 1994](../bibliography)).

With advance access to lecture notes, students can preview the content
and organize their thoughts, allowing them to follow along more
effectively during lectures. This practice helps alleviate the cognitive
load that comes with simultaneously processing new information and
taking notes ([Bui and Myerson, 2014](../bibliography/#Bui)).

In the context of subjects such as mathematics, physics, and statistics,
where lectures can be content-heavy and fast-paced, having access to
course materials beforehand allows students to familiarize themselves
with complex concepts and terminology. This pre-exposure can
significantly enhance their understanding and engagement during the
actual lecture.

In particular, autistic students often benefit from having predictable
and structured environments. Advance access to course materials helps
reduce anxiety and allows them to process information at their own pace,
leading to a more inclusive learning experience ([Gurbuz et al.,
2019](../bibliography/#Gurbuz)).

Students with physical disabilities, who may experience chronic pain or
fatigue, may face difficulties attending all classes or staying focused
throughout long lectures. These students may rely on pre-uploaded
materials to keep up with the coursework on days when their symptoms are
more severe.

By uploading materials in advance, you can help to ensure that students
are not disadvantaged by their disabilities and that all students can
engage with the course content in a flexible manner ([Sambrook & Rowley,
2010](../bibliography/#Sambrook)).

### How should I do this?

#### The basics

-   Ensure that materials are uploaded to Canvas at least one week in
    advance, the further in advance the better. This includes all course
    materials, i.e., lecture notes, slides, practice problems and
    solutions, etc.
-   All course materials being available on Canvas from the start of the
    semester is the ideal.
-   Materials being provided only 24 hours in advance should not be
    viewed as the standard, but as the bare minimum legal requirement.

#### Using a course schedule

Develop a course schedule outlining what will be covered, when it will
be covered, and when materials will be made available if they are not
already.

When creating this schedule, include enough detail so that, at the
beginning of the semester, students could feasibly search for and find
alternative external resources that are relevant to the course.

Ensure that this schedule is on the module's Canvas page at the point
of publication and stick to it as closely as possible. If changes must
be made to this schedule, communicate this to students as soon as
possible and update the relevant materials in a timely manner.

If it is truly not possible to provide a particular resource in advance,
provide students with outlines of key topics/theorems/results etc., so
that students are able to find alternative resources in advance of
teaching sessions, and encourage them to do so. Perhaps also consider
collating some external resources to which you could point students to
in situations like this.

### Who does it benefit?

Every student!

But in particular, the [Supportive Practice
Tool](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/learning-and-teaching/effective-practice/universal-design/supportive-practice-tool/)
 and the list of disability specific
[reasonable
adjustments](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/learning-and-teaching/support-and-student-skills/personal-tutoring/resources-and-training/reasonable-adjustments/)
 provided by Student Health and Wellbeing
Service (SHWS) suggest that the following disabilities/conditions may
necessitate this adjustment:

-   ADHD
-   Anxiety
-   Autism
-   Depression
-   Specific Learning Difficulty (SpLD)

Note: this is not an all-encompassing nor exhaustive list. Some students
with the above disabilities/conditions may not require this adjustment
and many other disabilities/conditions not listed may necessitate this
adjustment

### This might be difficult if

- **You're writing the notes as you go.** It can be unavoidable! Try your best to get material online as soon as you can.
- **The course schedule changes during the semester.** Unforeseen events such as illness, industrial action and adverse weather can mean you have to change when things happen or leave out some material. All you can do is keep students up to date.

## ReCap all in-person sessions 

### Why should I do this?

Students with various mental disabilities, such as depression, anxiety,
specific learning disabilities (SpLD), ADHD, and autism, often
experience difficulties with working memory ( [Christopher and
Macdonald, 2005](../bibliography/#Christopher); [Lukasik et al., 2019](../bibliography/#Lukasik);
[Grant, 2017](../bibliography/#Grant); [Habib et al., 2019](../bibliography/#Habib)). [Bui
and Myerson (2014)](../bibliography/#Bui) note that in the context of lectures,
the task of note-taking directly correlates with part of the definition
of working memory: "the ability to temporarily store and manipulate
information." ( [Baddeley, 1992](../bibliography/#Baddeley)). Students need to hold
the lecturer's words in their mind, understand and organize the
information, paraphrase it effectively, and write it down---all
simultaneously.

Additionally, students with physical disabilities may also struggle with
working memory due to their condition, often referred to as "brain fog"
([McWhirter et al., 2023](../bibliography/#McWhirter)). For example, individuals with
chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME), long COVID,
fibromyalgia, and other conditions causing chronic pain and/or fatigue,
often experience working memory difficulties ( [Berryman et al.,
2013](../bibliography/#Berryman); [Callan et al., 2022](../bibliography/#Callan); [Liu et al.,
2021](../bibliography/#Liu)).

Providing access to high-quality lecture capture, along with guidance on
how to engage with this resource, is an effective way to support all
students' learning, particularly those with working memory challenges (
[Sanders, 2022](../bibliography/#Sanders); [Bennett, 2018](../bibliography/#Bennett)).

### How should I do this?

It is important to recognise that in order to harness the benefits of
lecture capture, careful consideration must be taken in how the lecture
will be viewed as a recording.

That is, a ReCap recording of a black screen and audio of the lecture
(which may be difficult to hear if the instructor is not using a
microphone) will not provide the same benefits outlined above and does
not serve the intended purpose of lecture recording.

#### General guidance

-   Check that ReCap is set up and working correctly before every
    teaching session.
-   Ensure that anything that is visible or audible in the lecture is
    visible and audible in the ReCap recording.
-   Ensure you are using a microphone and that it works, even if you
    don't think it is needed.
-   If there are no lavalier/lapel microphones available in the teaching
    space, be mindful of where the ReCap audio is being recorded from
    and stay close to it or increase the volume of your speech.
-   Consider creating a backup plan for when the technology in the
    teaching space is not usable - there will always be the
    possibility that the technology fails. This could include using
    your own devices to record the lecture live and uploading this to
    Canvas, or recording a new version of the lecture at a later time.

and many other disabilities/conditions not listed may necessitate this

### This might be difficult if

- **Your preferred style of instruction is to use the boards.** None of the university's teaching spaces currently provide an easy means of recording the whiteboards. 
- Your lecture delivery is highly interactive.
- **You do not feel confident with the technical skills required.** The Digital Learning Unit are happy to offer advice and support.

## Clear communication in writing 

### Why should I do this?

Students with various mental disabilities, such as depression, anxiety,
specific learning disabilities (SpLD), ADHD, and autism often experience
difficulties with remembering verbal instructions and organizing
information ([Boucher, 2009](../bibliography/#Boucher); [Barkley,
2014](../bibliography/#Barkley); [Reid, 2016](../bibliography/#Reid); [Christopher &
Macdonald, 2005](../bibliography/#Christopher); [Lukasik et al., 2019](../bibliography/#Lukasik);
[Grant, 2017](../bibliography/#Grant); [Habib et al., 2019](../bibliography/#Habib)). For
example, autistic students may struggle to remember verbal instructions
and often prefer information in a visual format because it can be
processed and referred to over time, unlike spoken communication, which
is instant and quickly forgotten ( [Howard & Sedgewick,
2021](../bibliography/#Howard)). Written communication allows students to refer
back to information as needed, reducing unnecessary cognitive load and
helping them stay organized.

Additionally, students with physical disabilities may also struggle with
cognitive functions due to their condition, often referred to as "brain
fog" ([McWhirter et al., 2023](../bibliography/#McWhirter)). For example, individuals
with chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME), long
COVID, fibromyalgia, and other conditions causing chronic pain and/or
fatigue, often experience working memory difficulties ( [Berryman et
al., 2013](../bibliography/#Berryman); [Callan et al., 2022](../bibliography/#Callan); [Liu et
al., 2021](../bibliography/#Liu)). Clear written communication provides these
students with a reliable reference, reducing the need to rely on
impaired memory functions.

When written communication is not provided, students might spend
unnecessary time and effort re-watching lectures just to find specific
verbal statements/instructions, which can be particularly taxing for
those with limited time due to their disabilities ([Lambert & Dryer,
2017](../bibliography/#Lambert); [Holloway, 2001](../bibliography/#Holloway)), or they may miss
out on the information all together, putting them at a disadvantage.
Students with disabilities often face a higher cognitive load and
significant time constraints, indeed many disabled people describe
managing their disability as akin to having an additional job, involving
numerous administrative tasks and medical appointments ([Vickerman &
Blundell, 2010](../bibliography/#Vickerman)). These responsibilities add to their
overall cognitive and time burdens. For these students, clear written
communication about key course information is not just a convenience but
a necessity.

This practice not only supports students with disabilities but also
improves the learning experience for all students by providing a
reliable reference that can be accessed at any time ( [Wilson,
2017](../bibliography/#Wilson); [Schelly et al., 2011](../bibliography/#Schelly)).

### How should I do this?

#### The basics

- **Module changes:** Communicate any changes to the structure or content of the module to
students **as soon as possible in as many forms as possible** . For example, as
a Canvas announcement *and* as a lecture shout-out *and* mark any
revisions or updates on the relevant document and/or Canvas page.

- **Instructions:** Where specific instructions are given to students, **provide a written
copy** . For example, instructions on how to import a specific dataset/module
in R/Python, or when giving directions around campus.

- **Written summaries of verbal conversations:** After one-on-one meetings or office hours, provide students with a
written summary of the key points discussed and any agreed-upon action
items or advice. Alternatively, allow (and encourage) the student to
make notes or record and be mindful of how fast you may be going, making
sure the student can keep up.

#### Canvas

- **Detailed syllabus/schedule:** Provide a comprehensive syllabus and schedule on Canvas at the beginning
of the course that outlines the topics, *when* they will be covered, and
assignment deadlines.

- **Centralise key information:** Ensure all key information is centralized in one easily accessible
location (i.e., the Modules page of your Canvas course). **Use clear
headings and subheadings** to organize content logically by date,
chapter or topic.

- **Mark duplicated resources, updates and revisions:** If a particular resource is published on the Canvas course multiple
times (For example, lecture notes in different formats, updated or redacted
versions of documents) **it should be clear to students where content is
duplicated, and where revisions or updates are made** (including
correction of typos) this should be noted so that students can
accurately update their own notes.

#### Going the extra mile

The following suggestions are given to inspire you to consider different
ways you can communicate and present information to make your course
even more inclusive. Of course, they also provide more effective and
engaging education across the board!

- **Weekly outlines:** Create weekly outlines that summarize the key concepts, objectives, and
tasks for each week. This helps students keep track of what they need to
focus on and prepare for, helping them manage their time effectively.

- **Summarise key definitions, theorems, etc:** List and summarise key definitions, theorems, proofs, etc in a written
format to help students organise their revision. Tell students what must
be memorised and what will be provided in the exam.

- **FAQs:** Maintain a frequently updated FAQ section on the course platform
addressing common questions from students and signposting additional
external resources or readings.

- **Student feedback:** Regularly solicit feedback from students (in addition to the current
feedback mechanisms) about the clarity and accessibility of the written
materials, the Canvas course, and communication methods. Use this
feedback to make continuous improvements.

Note: this is not an all-encompassing nor exhaustive list. Some students
with the above disabilities/conditions may not require this adjustment
and many other disabilities/conditions not listed may necessitate this
adjustment

### This might be difficult if

- **You're dyslexic.** Find a way of communicating with students that works for both you and them, and tell students how they can find the information they need. Prioritise writing down the most important information. Talk to [People Services](https://newcastle.sharepoint.com/hub/people-services/Pages/Colleague-Support-and-Wellbeing/disability.php.aspx) about whether you could receive support or adjustments to help you.
- **You don't have enough time.** Plan for the time you'll need to spend communicating with students. It's just as important as in-person lecture time. Being systematic about communicating regular events such as assignments can be more efficient.
