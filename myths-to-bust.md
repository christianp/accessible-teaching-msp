## Myths to bust

When it comes to accessible and inclusive teaching, several persistent
myths act as a barrier to the implementation of necessary accommodations
for students with disabilities. These myths reflect common
misconceptions and responses encountered when students request
reasonable adjustments.


### Students won't attend lectures if they are all on ReCap

Contrary to common concerns, there is no systematic evidence that
lecture capture leads to lower attendance! Although research on this
topic varies in conclusions and methodologies, a consistent finding
emerges: lecture capture has little to no impact on student attendance
nor academic achievement, and the benefits outweigh the potential
drawbacks.

Literature reviews by [Witthaus & Robinson (2015)](../bibliography/#Witthaus) and
[Banerjee (2021)](../bibliography/#Banerjee), support this conclusion. They
highlight that the real focus should be on maximizing the effectiveness
of lecture capture, rather than questioning its use. By emphasizing best
practices, we can transform lecture capture into a powerful educational
tool that enhances learning outcomes.

Moreover, the vast majority of students use lecture recordings as a
supplementary resource, not a replacement for in-person classes
[(Leadbeater et al., 2013)](../bibliography/#Leadbeater). This usage pattern
underscores the value of lecture capture in reinforcing and
complementing traditional learning.

To fully realize these benefits, it is suggested that lecturers should
clearly communicate the advantages and potential drawbacks of lecture
capture. Providing explicit guidance on how to effectively engage with
lecture recordings can help students avoid the potential negative
effects [(Leadbeater et al., 2013)](../bibliography/#Leadbeater).

### Disabled students' adjustments should be dealt with case-by-case

The current system of only providing adjustments to students on a
case-by-case basis using a Student Support Plan (SSP) is not fit for
purpose.

The increase in the number of students with disclosed disabilities at
Newcastle University indicates that we must consider a different
approach. The numbers speak for themselves: the number of students with
disclosed disabilities in 2010/11 was 1,075, the count has nearly
quadrupled to 4,114 in 2023/24, and more than doubled since 2017/18.

This explosive growth highlights a critical issue: the case-by-case
method is overwhelmed and unsustainable. Disabled students deserve a
system that proactively supports their needs rather than one that reacts
slowly and inconsistently. The current approach often leaves students
without essential adjustments, violating their rights under [The
Equality Act (2010)](../bibliography/#EqualityAct), causing unnecessary stress and
hindering their academic performance. It also places an unnecessary time
burden on module leaders through the expectation that they will read
through each SSP they are sent and implement each adjustment
individually.

There is a strong evidence base that implementing universal design for
learning (UDL) principles can address this problem effectively. UDL
emphasizes flexible learning environments that accommodate diverse
learning styles and needs from the outset, benefiting all students---not
just those with disabilities. By embedding accessibility into the very
fabric of educational practices, equitable access to learning
opportunities for everyone can be ensured.

Under a UDL framework, many common adjustments would be provided by
default, significantly reducing the workload associated with individual
SSPs. This proactive approach allows educators to focus their efforts on
more specific and uncommon adjustments that truly require individualized
attention. SSPs would still play a crucial role in addressing unique
needs, but their scope and complexity would be significantly
streamlined.

###Â Students will disclose their disability and have an appropriate SSP, or
will ask the module leader directly for adjustments

It is incorrect to assume that students will disclose their disability
to anybody at the university nor that they will subsequently receive an
appropriate SSP.

There are several reasons why a student may not disclose their
disability, including the fear of stigmatization, discrimination, or not
being taken seriously. In addition to this, some may not even know their
condition qualifies as a disability or may not have an accurate
diagnosis. This can leave students struggling without the support they
genuinely need which can affect their academic performance and
well-being. To highlight these points, consider the following quotes
from students at a UK university where [Eccles et al.
(2018)](../bibliography/#Eccles) conducted focus groups on the issue of disability
disclosure:

> "sometimes it's also about culture because in my country if you
> say you have a disability, you're just like pointed at, people
> point fingers at you, so you just prefer not to say or not be seen
> with a disability"


> "[I] didn't want to get diagnosed because I wanted to have the
> same opportunities as other students without disabilities"


> "I think if you have a mental disability, the stigma attached to
> that could potentially be that people will think you're not of
> sound mind, that you could be unpredictable, people usually expect
> the worst..."


> "My flatmate's only just been diagnosed with anxiety, dyspraxia,
> dyscalculia and dyslexia, and only just now because she failed a
> unit... so obviously she didn't fill it out on her form because
> she didn't know"


> "A lot of people are undiagnosed as well; like I've got slow
> processing, dyslexia, dyspraxia, and like - I just thought it was
> me, I thought it was normal"


> "They might just refuse to tell themselves that they're disabled
> in any way or not want to accept it"


> "I think it's quite non-specific so if somebody has something like
> maybe mental disability like anxiety or something like that, they
> wouldn't write it down because they don't think that they are
> properly disabled but they might technically be"


> "because it [the application] is so important, they wouldn't
> want to risk it - the risk associated with declaring a disability,
> the application could be rejected or turned down due to this
> factor"


Even when a student has disclosed their disability, the current system
is not especially effective for devising and implementing SSPs. It is
slow, bureaucratic, and not capable of giving students timely access to
the changes they need to make learning feasible. Additionally, there is
little to no guarantee that the alterations provided will be consistent.

Universal Design for Learning (UDL) is an effective solution to this
problem [(Schreuer & Sachs 2014)](../bibliography/#Schreuer). UDL is an educational
framework based on the needs of various learners that is in place
beforehand, placing less importance on disclosures and SSPs.

Teaching under a UDL framework would a priori include some of the most
common adjustments required, such as providing lecture notes in advance
and creating course materials in an accessible format. This lessens the
need for individual disclosures and ensures that the students who do
require very specific individual adjustments can have them provided
efficiently. More tailor-made SSPs will still prove necessary for those
uncommon needs, but the system would be more efficient and not
scattergun, providing timelier and more focused support.

Furthermore, relying less on individual disclosure can lead to a more
inclusive and supportive campus culture. Students can be supported
without the worry of shame or the burden of proof that they are
"disabled enough" to need accommodations. This shift isn't only of
benefit to students with disabilities, but it improves the learning
environment for all.

A proactive, inclusive approach through UDL helps to ensure success for
each student and lessens the workload of module leaders. This shift to
inclusive teaching practices is urgently needed and has been advocated
for in the literature for a long time, yet evidence shows it is not
being done. To quote [Morina (2024)](../bibliography/#Morina),

> "More than 20 years have passed since [Stage & Milne's study
> (1996)](../bibliography/#Stage), yet the results are similar to those reported
> by the two most recent articles included in this systematic review
> [(Grimes et al. 2020; Vergunst & Swartz 2022)](../bibliography/#Vergunst). This
> finding both surprises and concerns us, and prompts us to ask: have

### Adjustments provide an advantage to disabled students

The belief that adjustments provide an advantage to disabled students is
a common misconception. Reasonable adjustments are designed to level the
playing field, not to give any student an upper hand. They are essential
for ensuring equitable access to education, allowing all students to
demonstrate their abilities and knowledge under fair conditions.
[(Equality Act 2010, s.20)](../bibliography/#EqualityAct)

Reasonable adjustments, such as extended time for exams or alternative
assessment methods, are necessary to accommodate the diverse needs of
students with disabilities. These measures do not compromise academic
standards; instead, they uphold the integrity of the assessment process
by mitigating barriers that may otherwise impede the demonstration of a
disabled student's true capabilities. [(Equality and Human Rights
Commission, 2014)](../bibliography/#EHRC)

Indeed, [Vidal Rodeiro & Macinska (2022)](../bibliography/#Vidal) found that even
when accounting for group differences (e.g., socio-economic status) that
could affect performance, students who received accommodations for
high-stakes examinations (GCSE exams in the UK) performed similarly to
or slightly worse than students without accommodations. This highlights
that reasonable adjustments in fact equalize educational attainment and
opportunity across disabled and non-disabled students, rather than
providing an unfair advantage.

### Students learn more from handwritten notes

While some studies suggest that handwriting may enhance memory retention
for certain tasks, this perspective fails to consider the diverse needs
and abilities of all students, particularly those with disabilities.

Students with disabilities, such as dyslexia, dysgraphia, autism, ADHD,
and various physical impairments, can face significant challenges with
handwriting. For these students, the act of writing by hand can be a
barrier to effective learning. Dysgraphia, for instance, affects fine
motor skills and handwriting fluency, making it difficult for students
to take notes quickly and legibly. Similarly, students with dyslexia may
struggle with the speed and accuracy required for handwriting, while
those with ADHD or autism might find it hard to concentrate on both
listening and writing simultaneously.

Many students find it useful to engage with lecture material by
reviewing lecture notes prior to the class. By familiarizing themselves
with the content in advance, they can use the lecture to consolidate,
confirm, and expand their understanding ([Bui & Myerson,
2014](../bibliography/#Bui)). This pre-lecture preparation can be particularly
beneficial for students who need more time to process information or who
benefit from a structured approach to learning and is especially useful
in complex and cognitively demanding subjects such as mathematics. Prior
access to materials containing lecture content can significantly enhance
comprehension and retention, particularly for students whose disability
may affect their processing speed and working memory.

Another important consideration is the use of "gappy notes", i.e.,
lecture notes that intentionally leave out proofs, examples, or key
details for students to fill in during the lecture. While this approach
might be intended to encourage active engagement, and some students find
them very useful, it can be particularly challenging for students with
disabilities if an alternative version with no gaps is not provided. For
example, students with processing difficulties or attention disorders
may struggle to fill in these gaps accurately and quickly, leading to
incomplete or incorrect notes.
