# Accessible teaching for maths, stats and physics

This document was made by Scarlett Spackman and Christian Lawson-Perfect as part of a Summer project in 2024.

Scarlett is an undergraduate MMath student leaving Stage 3.

Christian is a senior learning software developer in the digital learning unit.

The purpose of this page is to show the importance of implementing reasonable adjustments in response to student needs and to offer you practical guidance on how to implement these adjustments efficiently. We argue that adopting a more inclusive teaching style using universal design principles is a good place to start and that embracing these changes will foster a supportive and fair learning environment that empowers each student, disabled or not, to reach their maximum potential.
