This document was made by Scarlett Spackman and Christian Lawson-Perfect as part of a
Summer project for [Newcastle University's School of Mathematics, Statistics and Physics](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/maths-physics/) in 2024.

Scarlett is an undergraduate MMath student leaving Stage 3.

Christian is a senior learning software developer in the [digital learning unit](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/maths-physics/engagement/digital-learning).

The purpose of this page is to show the importance of implementing
reasonable adjustments in response to student needs and to offer you
practical guidance on how to implement these adjustments efficiently. We
argue that adopting a more inclusive teaching style using universal
design principles is a good place to start and that embracing these
changes will foster a supportive and fair learning environment that
empowers each student, disabled or not, to reach their maximum
potential.

> This guidance was prepared by Scarlett under my supervision.
> The guidance is based on Scarlett's experience during her studies and 
> shared experiences of other students but the recommendations are backed
> by findings from published research.
> I intend this to be a living document, expanding as our understanding of
> accessible teaching improves and in response to feedback from both 
> teaching staff and students.
